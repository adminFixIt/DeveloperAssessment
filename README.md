Developer Assessment Task

Thank you for taking the time to completed the developer assessment task for FixIt Service Pros.  This assessment has two components to it.

- Programming assessment
- Short Answers to questions

In order to ensure that you can deliver your assessment, you will be added to a Google Drive so that you can submit your assessment.  You will need a Gmail or Google-based email account in order to be added to the folder.  Your interviewer will add you to the Google Drive folder and reach out to you if you do not have a Google-based email account.
**Please do not email your response**, we don't want to run into attachment size issues or your submission accidentally being missed.

### Programming Assessment
You are tasked with building a simple web application that mimicks the FixIt Service Pros web app.  You are to build an App that will allow a client to book a service job and then after the job is booked they are able to view their booked job in a user friendly format. 

Your app must do the following:
- Allow a customer to select a service type that includes an hourly price (e.g. Plumbing, Eletrical, etc) -> See sample data below
- Save the customer's detail and service category
- Load the customer's job after is has been submitted to the application
- Appropriate validation for the submission

### Platform Choice
We are not restrictive on what platform you use for this assessment as long as it is a Web App that we can locally deploy.  We recommend the following however you can use what you are comfortable with.

- .Net(Full Framework or Core) 
- PHP

### Task Requirements
Use the *User Stories* below in order to build your web app.  Your app must meet the following requirements:
